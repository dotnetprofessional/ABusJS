0.4.0   *** BREAKING CHANGE ***
        * Existing code will need to change @iHandleMessages to @iHandleMessages()
        Added ability to handle mangling. When mangling code like is done in React-Native release builds, you need to add the
        @namespace decorator to all your messages when defining them as classes.
        Issues: #26, 25
