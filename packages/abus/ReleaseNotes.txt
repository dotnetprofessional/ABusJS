0.5.0   *** BREAKING CHANGE ***
        Changed the default transport to not keep messages queued after dispatching. This means if a handler fails to process the message it WILL NOT be 
        resent. The original transport is now LocalQueuedTransport. This will be reintroduced as part of the work to support multiply transports.
0.4.0   *** BREAKING CHANGE ***
        * Existing code will need to change @iHandleMessages to @iHandleMessages()
        Added ability to handle mangling. When mangling code like is done in React-Native release builds, you need to add the
        @namespace decorator to all your messages when defining them as classes.
