# API
The ABus API consists of the following core areas:

* [Concepts](concepts.md) 
* [Configuration](configuration.md)
* [Sending messages](sending-messages.md)
* [Receiving messages](receiving-messages.md)
* [Error handling](errors.md)
* [Sagas](saga.md)
* [Processes](process.md)
* [Pipeline](pipeline.md)
* [Transports](transports.md)
* [Cancellation Policies](cancellation-policies.md)

> __To fully understand the API docs, its going to be important to understand the core messaging concepts that Abus is built on. It is therefore recommended that the [Concepts](concepts.md) section be read before reading other sections.__

> The API documentation is adapted from the [NServiceBus](https://docs.particular.net/nservicebus/messaging/) and [MassTransit](https://masstransit-project.com) documentation.
